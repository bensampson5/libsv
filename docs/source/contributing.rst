.. _submitfeedback:

Feature requests and feedback
-----------------------------

We'd like to hear about your propositions and suggestions.  Feel free to
`submit them as issues <https://github.com/bensampson5/libsv/issues>`_ and:

* Explain in detail how they should work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.  This will make it easier to implement.

Or create/join a discussion in the `LibSV discussion page <https://github.com/bensampson5/libsv/discussions>`_.


.. _report_bugs:

Report bugs
-----------

Report bugs for LibSV in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/bensampson5/libsv/issues>`_.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting,
  specifically the Python interpreter version, installed libraries & packages
  (i.e. cocotb, verilator, pytest), and whether or not you're using a LibSV Docker
  image.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you can write a demonstration test that currently fails but should pass
(xfail), that is a very useful commit to make as well, even if you cannot
fix the bug itself.
